//A. Q&A
//1. Using let or const, for example: "let variable = 42;"
//2. Using the "=" operator, for example: "variable = 1776;"
//3. Also use "=" operator, e.g. "newvar = variable;"
//4. Wait, what?
//5. Pseudocode is highly human-readable text that has the structure
//   of code, and thus can serve as a guide to structuring the actual
//   code.
//6. Something like 3/4 thinking, 1/4 typing.
